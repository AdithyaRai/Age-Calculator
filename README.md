An **age calculator in C++** is a program that determines a person's current age based on their date of birth.

Typically, it involves:

1.  **Inputting the birth date:** The user provides their year of birth.
2.  **Getting the current date:** The program usually obtains the current date from the system.
3.  **Calculating the difference:** It then calculates the difference between the birth year and the current year.
4.  **Outputting the age:** The calculated age is then displayed to the user.
